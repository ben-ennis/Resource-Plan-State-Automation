# Resource Plan State Automation
ServiceNow ITBM - Resource Plan State Automation

This functionality was created in the Flow Designer on the NY release. Its purpose is to automatically close all resource plans attached to a project when it is closed. Additionally, for example purposes we populated the "End Date" field on the resource plan with the "Planned End Date" of the project upon closure. Keep in mind this is conceptual in nature and this workflow can be modified to fit your organizations needs.
